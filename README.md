# Weather Widget

## Project Summary

**Weather Widget** is a dynamic, responsive web application that allows users to search for real-time weather data by city. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it integrates with the **OpenWeather API** to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather information, including current conditions and a 5-day forecast.

Designed with a clean, mobile-friendly interface, the application provides an intuitive user experience while showcasing best practices in API consumption, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. Users can input any city name, receive weather details instantly, and view relevant forecast data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visual weather icons.

This project demonstrates how front-end technologies can be effectively combined with external APIs to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
