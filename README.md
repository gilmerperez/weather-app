# Weather Widget

## Project Summary

Weather Widget is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for real-time weather data by city. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend, it securely integrates with the OpenWeather API through an environment-protected proxy server.

The application features a clean, mobile-friendly interface that delivers accurate weather information including temperature, humidity, and conditions. The backend architecture demonstrates secure API key management using .env variables, preventing exposure in client-side code while maintaining seamless frontend functionality.

This project showcases modern web development practices including REST API consumption, DOM manipulation, responsive design, and secure server-side API key handling. Users can input any city name and instantly receive weather data through the protected backend endpoint, which processes requests while keeping sensitive credentials secure.
